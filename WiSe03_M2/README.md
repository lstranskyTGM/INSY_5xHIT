# Our Experience with Papyrus Converse

_Julian Neuwirth, Leonhard Stransky (14.12.2024)_

Recently, our IT department at TGM Vienna had the chance to visit ISIS Papyrus, a company known for its innovative business software solutions. As part of the visit, we were introduced to Papyrus Converse, their no-code platform for managing and optimizing processes. We even received a test version to try out ourselves. Here’s what we learned during this exciting experience.

## What Was the Goal of the Seminar?

The main goal of the seminar was to give us a hands-on introduction to Papyrus Converse and show how businesses can use it to streamline their operations. It was also about connecting what we learn in school with real-world applications. By seeing how companies use technology like this, we got a better understanding of how IT can solve practical problems and make processes more efficient.

## The Advantages of Flexible Processes

One key takeaway from the seminar was the importance of flexibility in business processes. In today’s fast-changing world, companies need systems that can adapt quickly to new situations or challenges. Papyrus Converse makes this possible by allowing users to create or adjust processes without needing programming skills.

Some advantages of flexible processes include:

- **Faster Adaptation:** Businesses can respond quickly to changes, like new customer demands or market trends.
- **Efficiency:** Processes can be optimized by removing unnecessary steps, saving time and resources.
- **Improved Customer Experience:** Tailored processes lead to better service and happier customers.
- **Innovation:** Flexibility encourages companies to experiment and improve continuously.

We saw live examples of how Papyrus Converse integrates tools like AI (e.g., IBM Watsonx) to automate repetitive tasks and provide smart suggestions, making processes even more dynamic.

## How Are Value Streams Defined with Papyrus Converse?

Another interesting concept we learned about was value streams. A value stream represents all the steps needed to deliver value to a customer. With Papyrus Converse, defining these streams becomes straightforward thanks to its intuitive design.

Here’s how it works:

- **Start with the Goal:** You begin by identifying the outcome you want (e.g., onboarding a new customer).
- **Break It Down:** Each step is modeled as part of the process, including tasks, forms, and decisions.
- **No-Code Interface:** The platform’s drag-and-drop functionality makes it easy for non-developers to create workflows.
- **Automation & Integration:** Papyrus Converse connects with other systems and automates tasks where possible.

For example, if you’re creating a process for handling customer support requests, you can define steps like receiving the request, assigning it to the right team, resolving the issue, and following up—all within one streamlined workflow.

## Our Reflection on the Visit

At first, many of us weren’t sure what to expect from this visit. However, it turned out to be an eye-opening experience. We got a glimpse into how companies use technology not just as tools but as strategies for growth and efficiency. The seminar also showed us how IT professionals work closely with business teams to create solutions that are both innovative and practical.

It was inspiring to see how platforms like Papyrus Converse simplify complex tasks and make them accessible even for people without technical backgrounds. This visit definitely gave us new ideas for our own projects and future careers in IT.

## Conclusion

Our visit to ISIS Papyrus was both educational and exciting. We learned about the importance of flexibility in processes, how value streams can be defined using modern tools like Papyrus Converse, and how these innovations are shaping businesses today.

We’re grateful for this opportunity and would like to thank ISIS Papyrus for giving us this insight into their work. It’s experiences like these that help us connect classroom learning with real-world applications—and motivate us to keep exploring the possibilities of IT!
